Dear Professor

Until the day of the competition we were still working on the robot in our own lab (in the basement of the EV building).
A lack of time and a hive like environment didn't allow for the proper adjustment of colors to the lighting conditions
of the competition room,that is why our robot lost the obstacle color during the scaping step and went out of the workspace.
However, our robot does work very well when tuned to the settings of our development lab in the basement of the EV building.
The videos included in this file show that the robot go through all the operations perfectly.
